Matthew Schreiber: CrossbowJohnson Museum of ArtMatthew Schreiber’s immersive laser light installation Crossbow is named after a roller coaster in New Jersey. Reminiscent of optical devices found in novelty stores and 1970s sci-fi films, Schreiber’s environment reaches back to a not-so-distant past in which technology seemed to promise utopian visions of a brighter future. His work is part of an artistic tradition of light art that dates back to at least the beginning of the twentieth century: artists like El Lissitzky and Lázló Moholy-Nagy experimented with light in sculptural and architectural works in the 1920s and ’30s; Southern California’s Light and Space movement in the ’60s included James Turrell and Robert Irwin; and more recent light art examines both spectacle and its relationship to our contemporary existence, like the Johnson’s own Cosmos installation by Leo Villareal. Through the presentation of light in space, Schreiber’s Crossbow might make time and place seem temporarily suspended, reminding us of a fundamental aspect of art.

Revealed: WPA Murals from Roosevelt IslandJohnson Museum of ArtIn 1935, the Federal Art Project (FAP), a subdivision of President Roosevelt’s Work Progress Administration (WPA), was established. Over the next decade, thousands of artists were employed to create art for public spaces in federal buildings. Four murals—by artists Ilya Bolotowsky, Albert Swinden, Joseph Rugolo, and Dane Chanase—were commissioned for the Hospital of Chronic Diseases on Welfare Island (later Goldwater Memorial Hospital, Roosevelt Island) to decorate public rooms, where patients could relax in a quiet atmosphere. 
With the advent of the new Cornell Tech campus, Goldwater Hospital was set for demolition. Before this could happen, the murals needed to be located and removed. The Bolotowsky had been uncovered and cleaned in 2001 under the Municipal Art Society’s Adopt-a-Mural program, but the Swinden and Rugolo were still covered with multiple layers of white hospital paint, and the Chanase mural was never found. Over the past several years, the three murals have been cleaned and restored, the Bolotowsky by Fine Art Conservation Group and the Swinden and Rugolo by EverGreene Architectural Arts. This exhibition will be the first public viewing of portions of these murals before they are returned to new homes on the Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island campus.  





Performance Events
The fire is gone but we have the light: Rirkrit Tiravanija & Korakrit ArunanondchaiJohnson Museum of ArtRirkrit Tiravanija (Thai, b. Argentina, 1961) collaborated with more than forty master printers, graduate and undergraduate students, and others on his monumental print Untitled 2008–11 (the map of the land of feeling) at Columbia University’s LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies. Almost ninety feet long and taking three years to complete, it chronicles twenty years of Tiravanija’s peripatetic life, his recurring themes, and historical references. The print is on view for the first time at the Johnson in this exhibition.
While a graduate student at Columbia, Korakrit Arunanondchai (Thai, b. 1986) not only studied under Tiravanija but was also one of his collaborators on this ambitious project. In this exhibition, Arunanondchai continues his engagement with the history of art, philosophy, popular culture, tourism, and self-representation with new denim sculptures and video reminiscent of experimental documentaries. 





Performance Events
Tradition, Transmission, and Transformation in East Asian ArtJohnson Museum of ArtThe long history of interaction between China, Korea, and Japan formed an identifiable East Asian cultural sphere based on shared traditions of Confucian ethical philosophy, Buddhism, and a historically common writing system. In the arts this commingling resulted in new hybrid forms, as pictorial images and classical texts that originated in China were embraced as richly meaningful icons in Korea and Japan. While many images and artistic styles across the region show similarities to their Chinese models, local philosophical, historical, and aesthetic traditions transformed them in unique ways.
Through works of art from the Johnson’s collection, this exhibition focuses on the ink painting tradition and explores how cultural images and artistic styles that originated in China were adopted and adapted in Korea and Japan.

Farming for Change: Agroecology, Gender, and Climate Change Adaptation in Malawi and TanzaniaMann Library, 2nd Floor GalleryA new exhibit, on display through April in the Mann Library Gallery, chronicles some of the struggles and achievements of smallholder farming families in Malawi and Tanzania, in their efforts to improve food security, nutrition, social equity and sustainable land management in the face of climate change. The exhibit features photos and videos drawn from over fifteen years of participatory research carried out by Dr. Rachel Bezner Kerr (Development Sociology) and other researchers in collaboration with smallholder farmers. The projects depicted are resilient, sustainable, low-input farming systems that draw on smallholders’ agricultural knowledge and complex understanding of local environmental conditions.  Farmers have used community­ led educational strategies, such as recipe days, discussion groups and participatory theatre, to promote local knowledge of different recipes, food processing techniques, healthy child care practices and address gender and other social inequalities which are barriers to improved food security and nutrition. This approach has led to improved land management, food security and nutrition, and speaks to the resilience, strength and innovation of smallholder African farming families.

Latin American Studies Program Seminar SeriesStimson Hall, 105A talk with the artist Deborah Castillo.
Deborah Castillo: Political Iconoclasm and other Forms of Civil Disobedience examines the artist's own form of political dissidence as she responds to the increasingly repressive government of Venezuela. Taking the iconic figure of Simón Bolívar—liberator of much of South America—as a point of departure, Castillo investigates the myth of the nation through the construction of political and military heroes. Facing the regime of the late Hugo Chávez, the artist questions the rising nationalism engendered by the former Venezuelan president as he aligned his political campaign with the cult of Simón Bolívar. In a series of interventions into the classic bust of El Libertador, the artist reveals the failures of the state and its Utopian promises.
Despite being aware of Chávez's efforts to eliminate the opposition, Castillo enacted her first act of disobedience in a public performance where she licked the boot of a military official. Because of this cynical and dangerous act, the artist fell victim to government intimidation and persecution when Chávez declared her an enemy of the state on national television. Manifested through the play between adoration and hatred, construction and destruction, Castillo's works propose a critical look into the social and political history of Venezuela.
Castillo is a Venezuela-born, New York-based, multidisciplinary artist. She employs different mediums such as performance, video, photography, and sculpture in order to dissect the idea of power, its structures, and its weight on sexuality, social expectations, desire, identity, and the construction of contemporary myth. Castillo holds a M.F.A. and B.F.A. from Armando Reverón School of Fine Arts, Caracas, Venezuela. Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Arts and Design; the New Museum; Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City; Escuela de Bellas Artes; Bolivian Biennial SIART; Caja Sol, Sevilla; UCLA; ICA, London; and elsewhere. The artist has also been the recipient of several awards such as Premio Armando Reverón (2014); AVAP in the Young Artist Category (2013); and the Award Sala Mendoza at the XI Salón Eugenio Mendoza (2003), among others.
A conversation with the artist, sponsored by the Latin American Studies Program, the Department of Art History, the Curatorial Collective, and the Einaudi Center, will be held on Monday, April 4 at 12:15 p.m. in Stimson Hall, room 105. The opening gallery reception will be held at 5 p.m. on Monday, April 4, in Bibliowicz Family Gallery.

SAP Seminar Series -- Talent, Technique, Transformation: Musical Training and the Possibilities of the Self in Liberalizing India by Anaar Desai-StephensUris Hall, G08The South Asia Program (SAP) Seminar Series speaker, Anaar Desai-Stephens, will discuss the aspirational striving that permeates contemporary India centers on a fundamental question: How much can a person transform? More specifically, how much, and in what ways, must one transform in order to transcend the habitus of class and caste given to them at birth? This paper offers a musically grounded examination of this question through sites of popular music pedagogy and practice. Drawing on my research on the television show Indian Idol and fieldwork in Mumbai music schools, I examine discourses of musical talent and technique alongside practices of vocal improvement undertaken by aspiring singers. I situate these discourses and practices within a broader aspirational economy that promotes individual self-betterment and transformation in line with larger neoliberal and meritocratic ideologies emerging in India today. Beyond simply yielding insight into conceptions of musical potential, I argue that talent, technique, and vocal change illuminate tensions regarding the possibilities and limits of self-transformation in liberalizing India. 
Biography: Anaar Desai-Stephens is a Ph.D. candidate in Ethnomusicology at Cornell University. Her research focuses on the intersection between music, media, and subjectivity in contemporary India with an emphasis on reality music television shows. She is currently writing her dissertation, “Singing Through the Screen: “Indian Idol” and the Crafting of Selves in Neoliberal India,” with the support of the Howard Mayer Brown Fellowship from the American Musicological Society. Anaar is also an active musician, studying Hindustani vocal music and performing on violin with the Mumbai-based band Maati Baani and Cornell’s Palonegro ensemble.

Speaker:  Dr. Brad Ramshaw, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM
Title: Quantum materials in extreme magnetic fields
Abstract:  Frontiers in experimental physics often involve extreme environments: the lowest temperatures, the highest energies, the fastest timescales. Over the past two decades, pulsed magnetic fields have moved from a niche technique to an experimental powerhouse, routinely providing access to magnetic fields of up to 100 Tesla—five times what is commercially available. I will describe how we use the world-record magnetic fields available at Los Alamos National Labs to discover new phenomena in quantum materials. In particular, we used pulsed-fields up to 92 Tesla to measure the Fermi surface of the high-Tc superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+x as a function of hole doping. These measurements tell us how electron interactions in the system get stronger in a way that is correlated with the high superconducting transition temperature, and tie together several other recent experiments. I will also describe our more recent work in the new field of topological semimetals. In these systems, high magnetic fields allow us to access the `quantum limit’, where all electrons are confined to a single highly degenerate quantum state. Finally, I will outline exciting new directions for high-field research, and describe what further technique developments will be able to tell us about new quantum materials.

Communication Colloquium: The Qualified Self:  Social Media and the Accounting of Everyday LifeMann Library, 102Many of the ways we use mobile and social media today have longstanding precedents in historical media like diaries, scrapbooks, and home movies. What we think of as the social media revolution is part of a much longer story about the use of media for connecting people through the documenting and sharing of everyday life. The qualified self explores the ways we come to understand ourselves, our social connections, and the world around us through the media traces we create. Placing mobile and social media into a longer historical context helps to reveal what is really new about these contemporary communication technologies, what future services might learn from historical communication practices, and what fundamental aspects of the human experience emerge through a variety of media platforms.
 
Lee Humphreys is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at Cornell University. She is interested in the social uses and perceived effects of communication technology. Her research has explored mobile phone use in public spaces and emerging norms on mobile social networks both in the US and in Indonesia. Using qualitative field methods, she focuses on how people integrate communication technology in their everyday lives in order to facilitate identity management and social interaction. Her work also explores how people perceive privacy and surveillance issues around mobile social media. Her research also seeks to historicize new media. She teaches New Media & Society, Mobile Communication in Public Life, Qualitative Research Methods and the Sociology of Communication. She received her BS in Communication from Cornell University and her MA and PhD from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.

Climate Change Seminar - Planning Our Water Resources Systems for a Changing ClimatePlant Science Building, 233Led by: Scott Steinschneider (Biological & Environmental Engineering)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:  How should you plan a water system for long-term climate changes when you don’t know what those changes are going to be? This is one of the grand challenges facing water resource planners charged with providing society with one of its most basic needs. Hydrologic systems are arguably one of the most sensitive natural systems to long-term climate change, but projections of driving climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) at spatial scales relevant for these systems are highly uncertain. These uncertainties are further confounded by the diverse array of hydrologic settings that prevail across the globe, with their own histories of infrastructure development and governance, leading to adaptation strategies that are inherently local and thus difficult to generalize. This talk presents a history of emergent strategies to adapt water systems to climate change, with a focus on major theoretical developments and instances of their real-world application. I highlight the importance of other considerations for water systems planning besides climate to contextualize the issue of climate change within the complex web of other challenges faced by resource planners and managers. The talk concludes with some of my own thoughts on ways to move towards a sustainable water future in an ever-changing world.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The 2016 Cornell University Climate Change Seminar meets Monday afternoons through May 9.

CCCI: Cultural Heritage Fever in China: Discourse and PracticesGoldwin Smith Hall, Kaufmann Auditorium, G64Yujie Zhu, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Australian Centre on China in the World, Australian National University
Since the UNESCO World Heritage Convention was ratified by China in 1985, the country has had forty-eight of its national sites inscribed as World Heritage. The ratification of the World Heritage Convention expresses the country’s efforts to embrace globalization, build up its national identity, and pursue economic development through the revitalization of cultural traditions and the promotion of heritage tourism. 
Based on long term ethnographic research at heritage sites and cities in Yunnan, Sichuan and Shaanxi, this talk seeks to explore the multifaceted and contested nature of “cultural heritage fever” in contemporary China. I argue that culture heritage is not a global reward system, but a cultural, social phenomenon celebrated and contested by different actors. It is often not the local communities who identify what aspects of their culture should be preserved and presented. Instead, it is the central and local governments - with the help of the tourism industry, authorized agencies and mass media - that define ‘the authentic culture’ and promote it accordingly. The official heritage discourse utilizes the cultural expression of identity and sense of place and memory for political and economic control. In this presentation, I also discuss how heritage may be understood as having emotional, cultural and political consequences in peoples’ lives. Local communities are often not passive recipients of the ‘heritage effect’; rather, they consume, contest and negotiate to shape heritage policies and practices.

Seminar Title: Mechanical topological insulators: from metamaterials to active liquids
Abstract: The effect of constraints on a many-body system is a subject as deeply rooted in mechanical and robotic control theory as in modern theoretical physics. In this talk, I discuss how networks of springs or rigid bars connected by joints mimic electronic topological insulators with zero-energy edge and bulk modes. In some cases, solitons arise from the same constraint equations that, upon linearisation, predict topological edge modes. Non-linear field theories with a topological boundary term capture these zero modes coupled to domain walls or dislocations. Our real space approach goes beyond topological band theory and provides concrete guidelines to design metamaterials that break or fold in controlled ways. Finally, I discuss how to build classical Chern insulators using active liquids that flow spontaneously without external drive. The active flow generates a synthetic gauge field that breaks time-reversal symmetry. As a result, unidirectional acoustic waveguides emerge at sample edges and domain walls. These topological sound waves, immune to disorder, can propagate past obstacles without back-scattering.
Poster available.

Public Lecture: 100 Years of Relativity:  From  the Big Bang to Black Holes, Gravitational Waves and InterstellarRockefeller Hall, Schwartz AuditoriumRenown astrophysicist Kip Thorne, co-founder of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), and most recently executive producer and scientific advisor on the movie Interstellar and author of “The Science of Interstellar,” will be at Cornell to give a public talk. The talk will encompass gravitational waves, which were detected for the first time last September, black holes, the Big Bang, the warping of spacetime and, of course, Interstellar.
All of these seemingly disparate topics have a common thread: Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity, which is his theory of gravity, and its implications for our understanding of the cosmos.

BACHATA BEGINNER 1 introduces a music and social dance form with origins in bolero, and made widely popular in the Dominican Republic. Its slow tempo, high pitch and pop creates a smooth and sensual feel in dance. Like Salsa, Bachata works off of a three-four step timing and relies on strong lead-follow connection. Learning Bachata will add beautiful elements to your dance repertoire, including improved timing, footwork, movement, frame and posture.

FORMAT
Class begins with a body movement warm-up. We teach step variations and movement patterns in rotating lines. In the second half of class we apply these step patterns and turns in partner format, where combinations are formed through lead-follow. Class ends with a 10 minute practice session, where repetition of moves and individual assistance from instructors help students solidify skills.

SEAP Gatty Lecture SeriesKahin Center"A Physics Lesson: Humans as Media in Philippine Anti-Colonial Struggle"
Neferfti Tadiar, Professor, Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Barnard College, Columbia University
In this talk I propose a cultural archaeology of seemingly defunct human mediatic forms – the use of humans as the media of other humans’ will and expressive agency – that continue to operate despite the early 20th century U.S. colonial project to eradicate such forms through the implementation of universal standards of human life and experience in the making of citizen-man. I propose this archaeological project beginning with a reading of José Rizal’s 1891 novel, El Filibusterismo, a local catalyst in a broad social, economic and cultural revolution that would historically inaugurate not only a new nation, but also a new global moment of imperialism, in which the capitalist mode of production would reign supreme. I delve into this political moment of transformation of natives (naturales) into nationals, indios into free subjects, encapsulated by Rizal and the anti-Spanish colonial struggle in which he figured prominently, as one site for examining the role of human mediatic forms in an extensive history of Filipino social struggles against the evolving protocols of global capitalism. However, rather than seeing the practices and relations of humans as media as simply “resistance” to the precepts and protocols of “capitalism proper”, i.e., as a mode of accumulation predicated on modern freedom, I propose to understand the integral connections between such persistent forms of life, and the expanded reproduction of capital in and through the colonial world, in an attempt to consider overlooked forms of social cooperation and invention, which remain important resources for political and economic consideration in the present.

Raza Ahmad Rumi, scholar in residence at Ithaca College's Honors Program, is a writer, policy analyst, and journalist from Pakistan. Currently, he is also a visiting faculty member at New York University, a fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington, DC, and at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University.

In Pakistan, he worked in broadcast media as an analyst and hosted television shows. Rumi moved to the United States in 2014, after an assassination attempt in March 2014 due to his stance against extremism in Pakistan. Prior to his journalistic career, Rumi worked at the Asian Development Bank as a Governance Specialist where he worked on institutional reform and capacity development and edited several publications on public administration and governance. He started his career with Pakistan's civil service and also worked with United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in Kosovo.
He is the author of Delhi by Heart: Impressions of a Pakistani Traveler, published by Harper Collins. His book, The Fractious Path: Pakistan's Democratic Transition, will be published this summer by Harper Collins India.





Performance Events
Counter Narratives: Brooklyn, Carol, and an unfashionable genre’s makeoverMartha Van Rensselaer Hall, G87This year’s Academy Awards feature an interesting anachronism (and it’s not the one you’re thinking of – though it’s also not entirely unrelated): two nominees, one for best actress and one for best supporting actress, were recognized for roles as shopgirls working at department stores in 1950s New York. While this may seem like just a mildly interesting coincidence, there is more to this story. In the first half of the 20th century “shopgirl” wasn’t just a convenient job to give an attractive, working-class character. Shopgirls were ubiquitous in larger cultural discourses. They were the embodiment of American mass culture: paradigmatic consumers of mass-produced fashion and movies, and idealized upwardly mobile modern girls. Especially from the 1910s through the 30s, the industry courted this imagined audience with scores of shopgirl movies. Even more interesting, this once popular genre has a fairly definitive moment when historical forces related to gender, race, class, and labor politics rendered it unfashionable. That moment is the early 1950s. 
Recognizing that “history” films always have as much to say about the era they’re made in as the era they depict, I’ll place Brooklyn and Carol in context of the now nearly forgotten shopgirl narrative. A better understanding of the shopgirl’s past, and her particular associations with consumer culture and spectacle through movies and fashion can help shed light on current nostalgic re-visionings of the girls behind the counter.

Rodale Institute, 70 years of transitioning farms and farmers to organic productionEmerson Hall, 135Since 1942, when founder J.I.Rodale first wrote the words “Healthy Soil=Healthy Food=Healthy People” on a black board, Rodale Institute has been working to put science behind the meaning of the word organic as it pertains to agriculture. Now in 2016 we sit at the edge of one of the greatest transformations of US agricultural production when nearly 55% of farms and farmers will transition due to age. What will the new farmers and transitioned farms look like? What will society expect from farms? And how will these farms impact greater issues like climate change? These are the topics we’ll explore as we travel through time; past, present and future looking at farming through the lens of soil health and organic agriculture.

The Yellow Ticket - at Sage Chapel w/ live music - Free!Sage ChapelThe Yellow Ticket (1918) is a German drama made at the end of World War I and on the eve of the Russian revolution.  It stars an adolescent Pola Negri, who would later become the legendary femme fatale of the silent era, and tells the story of an innocent young Jewish woman from a Polish shtetl who is constrained by anti-Semitic restrictions to lead a double life in a brothel while attempting to study medicine in Tsarist Russia. The film includes precious footage of the former Jewish quarter of Warsaw and the people who once lived there.
 
 Alicia Svigals is a leading klezmer violinist and a founder of the Klezmatics, has written for violinist Itzhak Perlman, the Kronos Quartet, playwright Tony Kushner and singer Diane Birch, and has also collaborated with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, poet Allen Ginsburg and many others. Marilyn Lerner is a jazz pianist and improviser whose career includes deep explorations of traditional and free jazz, new music-tinged improvisation and Ashkenazic folk music. She has appeared with Tito Puente and Steve Lacy and performs with the Ugly Beauties Trio and avant-garde Ig Henneman Sextet.
 
Pre-eminent film scholar Tom Gunning said about the score:  "I believe this accompaniment to The Yellow Ticket is one of the most powerful I have heard. It evokes not only a sense of the contemporary context of the culture in which the film took place, but our awareness of what was done to it afterwards. The sound of piano, violin and the human voice evoke passion, energy and a profound sense of mourning, bridging the historical distance between us and this film as eloquently as does Pola Negri’s extraordinary face."
 
Cosponsored with the Cornell Council for the Arts, the Jewish Studies Program, the CU Klezmer Ensemble, the Dept of Music, the Cornell Institute for European Studies, the Arts Committee of Temple Beth-El, the Wharton Studio Museum and Tikkun v’Or.

Miss Representation ScreeningTatkon Center for First-Year Students, 3330Come see a free screening of Jennifer Siebel Newsom's award-winning documentary about the media's disparaging portayal of women. The media is selling young people the idea that girls’ and women’s value lies in their youth, beauty, and sexuality and not in their capacity as leaders. Miss Representation exposes how this culture contributes to the under-representation of women in positions of power and influence in America.

Yuri's Night at the Fuertes ObservatoryFuertes ObservatoryJoin the Cornell Astronomical Society at the Fuertes Observatory on Cornell's North Campus to celebrate human space flight and space exploration. The event will feature a lecture by Professor Mason Peck on NASA's planned mission to Europa (see description below), observing (weather permitting), tours of the historic observatory, astronaut food, and more from 7:30pm until midnight! 
Public Lecture (7:30pm): Alien Ocean: New Paths to Europa by Professor Mason Peck
Where would you send a probe to search for life in the solar system? Probably somewhere with a warm water ocean. It turns out that Earth is not the only such place. There’s Europa, Jupiter’s icy moon that has more than double Earth’s water. This talk will describe NASA’s plans for a robotic Europa mission, which will conduct detailed reconnaissance during a number of close flybys in the 2020s to determine whether or not the conditions there are suitable for life as we understand it. It will use ice-penetrating radar and magnetometers to understand the depth and salinity of the ocean. And it will look at the heat signatures from plumes erupting from the surface, if they can be found. We’ll also talk about some more speculative mission concepts, some of which are being developed at Cornell: among them, a soft robotic rover that could slither through the ice and jet around underwater like a squid, and a soda-bottle-size spacecraft carrying aluminum nanoparticles that would explosively react with ice and water on impact, creating a plume to be analyzed by a satellite overhead.

Statistical-based Compression of Climate Model OutputA. D. White House, 110Précis: Optimal ways to archive, access and analyze “Big Data” are challenges faced by many disciplines and are a key component of sustainable computing.  In the context of climate models, high-volume numerical data compression algorithms provide a possible solution, but since they are designed to compress generic scientific data sets, they do not account for the nature of climate model output and they compress only individual simulations. In this talk, we propose a different, statistics-based approach that explicitly accounts for the space-time dependence of the data in an initial condition ensemble. The set of estimated parameters is small (compared to the data size) and can be regarded as a summary of the essential structure of the ensemble output; therefore, it can be used to instantaneously reproduce the data in an ensemble with a substantial saving in storage and time. 
Bio: Dr Stefano Castruccio obtained his PhD in Statistics at the University of Chicago in 2013 under the supervision of Prof. Michael L. Stein, with a dissertation on global space-time models for climate ensembles. After a one-year postdoctoral appointment at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Prof. Marc G. Genton,, he was appointed Lecturer in Statistics in Newcastle University. 
His work focuses of several aspects of uncertainty quantification for environmental problems, spanning from climate model emulation, wind field forecasting, extreme events, and data compression.

SAP Seminar Series -- Worldly Affiliations: Artistic Practice, National Identity and Modernism in India, 1930-1990 by Sonal KhullarUris Hall, G08South Asia Program (SAP) guest Sonal Khullar will discuss her newly published book, Worldly Affiliations: Artistic Practice, National Identity and Modernism in India, 1930-1990, in the context of new global histories of modernism and recent exhibitions of contemporary art from India. Drawing on Edward Said’s notion of affiliation as a critical and cultural imperative against empire and nation-state, this book traces the emergence of a national art world in twentieth-century India and emphasizes its cosmopolitan ambitions and orientations. It focuses on four major Indian artists –Amrita Sher-Gil, Maqbool Fida Husain, K. G. Subramanyan, and Bhupen Khakhar—whose careers reveal a distinctive trajectory of modernism in the visual arts in India that is foundational to the representational practices of the present. Khullar analyzes the shifting terms of Indian artists’ engagement with the West –an urgent yet fraught project in the wake of British colonialism—and to a lesser extent with African and Latin American cultural movements like Négritude and Mexican muralism. Such cross-cultural negotiations were by no means exclusive to the artists of this study, but were the structural conditions for modernism in twentieth-century India.
Biography: Sonal Khullar is Associate Professor of South Asian Art at the University of Washington, Seattle. She is the author of Worldly Affiliations: Artistic Practice, National Identity and Modernism in India, 1930-1990 (University of California Press, 2015). Her research interests include global histories of modern and contemporary art, feminist theory, and postcolonial studies.

Communication Colloquium: Interactivity in Media, Messages and Sources:  Theory and Design of User Engagement and EmpowermentMann Library, 102This talk will reveal the reasons why online interactivity is so alluring, and discuss various ways in which specific features of media technology shape our psychology. The speaker’s Model of Interactivity Effects identifies three species of interactivity, based on 15 years of research at Penn State’s Media Effects Research Laboratory. Experiments described in the talk will illustrate how different types of interactivity differentially engage users and consequently their perception of media content as well as higher-order outcomes, such as empowerment. Findings advance communication theory about interactive media and guide design of modern media interfaces.
 
S. Shyam Sundar (PhD, Stanford University) is distinguished professor and founding director of the Media Effects Research Laboratory in the College of Communications at Penn State University.

Climate Change Seminar - Climate Change and Terrestrial EcosystemsPlant Science Building, 233Led by: Christine Goodale (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:  The terrestrial biosphere currently soaks up a quarter of current fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide, thus slowing the rate of climate change.  However, multiple processes drive this terrestrial carbon sink, and its future trajectory uncertain:  the uptake of CO2 by plant growth may increase in the future as the planet warms and atmospheric CO2 rises, but the availability of water and nutrients can limit that process; meanwhile, warming is likely increase decomposition and the release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, possibly turning the terrestrial sink to a net sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Tropical, temperate, and boreal ecosystems will respond differently as the planet warms, with diverging feedbacks to future climate. This seminar will introduce these key processes governing the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and will explore their likely feedbacks to future climate.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The 2016 Cornell University Climate Change Seminar meets Monday afternoons through May 9. This university-wide seminar provides important views on the critical issue of climate change, drawing from many perspectives and disciplines. Experts from both Cornell University and other universities will present an overview of the science of climate change and climate change models, the implications for agriculture, ecosystems, and food systems, and provide important economic, ethical, and policy insights on the issue.
The seminar is free and open to the Cornell and Ithaca Community at large, and will be videotaped and available via Webex.

Understanding the carbon allocation network for SorghumEmerson Hall, 135The complex history of sorghum domestication and improvement offers a wider range of genetic variations than found in many crops – for example, selection for carbohydrate rich seed/grain has increased harvest index (carbon partitioned to grain) in some genotypes while selection for fermentable-rich stalks or for raw biomass alone has increased stalk size while reducing seed size and output in others.  Rich natural variation in inflorescence architecture and seed morphology is used to classify S. bicolor races, and has been embellished by divergent selection applied to cultivated forms ranging from ‘broomcorn’ to the compact inflorescences and large seed of grain types.  Divergent selection regimes have also been applied to plant stature, with stalks of up to six meters being a key building material in Africa, but approximately one meter or less favored for mechanical harvest.  We continually attempt to build coordinated genetic and genomic resources that will greatly enrich evidence available to identify genes responsible for morphological and physiological diversity that differentiates S. bicolor races and/or adapts particular genotypes to their ultimate uses.

Field phenomics in plant breedingEmerson Hall, 135Abstract: Despite justified skepticism of statements in the modeling literature, some breeders have the expectation that the quantitative application of gene to phenotype understanding with crop models will contribute substantially to the future of plant breeding. This optimism is well-founded based on a committed investment in and experience of a strong integration of genetics, physiology, and modeling with commercial maize breeding programs. This degree of integration is beyond the capability of many public research efforts, although there are many initiatives to study ‘GxExM’ (Genotype by Environment by Management) in multiple crops around the world. Gene-based prediction of flowering time in wheat assist breeders to target germplasm with ‘safe’ flowering windows to avoid frost and heat. While generation of GxExM landscapes in sorghum can nudge the ‘fanciful’ area of physiology, it can be instructive when the underlying model is physiologically ‘robust,’ as well as provide testbeds for statistical models. Finally, a current need is integrating models with high-throughput phenomics systems to provide in-season prediction of model phenotypes, that can be ‘subtracted’ from observed data to remove impacts of ‘known’ traits and reveal the underlying residual genetics.

Effects of long-term management on soil organic matter and weed competition in organic soybeanEmerson Hall, 135Ecological weed management relies on cultural practices to reduce weed populations and weed competition with crops. This approach can buffer cropping systems against yield losses from weeds, and potentially increase profitability in both organic and non-organic cropping systems. Competitive interactions between weeds and crops can be manipulated by altering nutrient pools and the quantity and quality of organic matter. Long-term management legacies can influence these soil properties, and thus can influence weed-crop competition. We quantified weed-crop competition in a nested component experiment within the Cornell Organic Grain Cropping Systems Experiment in Aurora, NY. This long-term experiment was started in 2005 and compared four organic cropping systems that varied in fertility inputs, weed management, and tillage. Competition intensity between weed and soybean in each cropping system was quantified across an experimentally manipulated weed intensity gradient. Soil organic matter quantity, quality, and nutrient levels were also detailed in each system. Preliminary results indicate differences in weed-crop competition between cropping systems, which might be explained by differences in management legacy and soil properties.

“Charles and Barbara Burger Special Colloquium Series” -  Stellar Forensics with Explosions: Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and their EnvironmentsSpace Sciences Building, 105Nature's two magnificent explosions, long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) and stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe), are both products of collapsing massive stars. Yet, over the last 15 years, we have not determined the detailed make-up of the stellar progenitors of each kind of explosion, nor the conditions that lead to each kind of explosion in massive stripped stars. While long-duration GRBs emit relativistic jets of high-energy radiation, stripped SNe are core-collapse explosions whose massive progenitors have been stripped of their outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. Understanding the progenitors of different kinds of explosions impacts many fields of astrophysics, including using them as cosmological tools.
I will present a number of comprehensive observational studies that probe the explosion parameters, environments, and their metallicities of SNe with and without GRBs, as well as those of normal Stripped SNe, with the goal of constraining their explosions mechanisms and progenitor systems. I will conclude with an outlook on how the most promising venues of research - using the many existing and upcoming innovative surveys such as the Palomar Transient Factory and LSST - sheds new light on the diverse deaths of massive stars.

The Center for Reproductive Genomics (CRG) was founded in 2006 with a mission to promote state-of-the-art research in reproductive health and fertility. Our expertise focuses primarily on gamete biology with an emphasis on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the formation of viable gametes for sexual reproduction. The strength of the center lies in its strong ties between the basic sciences (based largely at Cornell’s Ithaca campus) and the clinical sciences (focused at Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan, NY). In addition, the translational aspects of our research extend to our strong interests in animal health due in part to our home in the College of Veterinary Medicine. Our research spans many aspects of reproductive health but its three distinct missions focus on reproduction, fertility, and women's health.

Anthropology Colloquium:  Charles HaleMcGraw Hall, 165Privatization of the “historic debt”?
Mapuche territorial claims and the forest industry in southern Chile
Charles R. Hale (University of Texas at Austin)
All but the most recalcitrant observers of the long-standing conflict between Mapuche indigenous people and the state in Chile speak of a “historic debt” that dates back to the 19th century, when the Chilean state seized Mapuche lands through military conquest.  But these same observers—including many state functionaries themselves—generally admit that after more than two decades of democratic rule, the “debt” remains unpaid, and each year the conflict deepens.  Improbably, the only new initiatives for amelioration have come from the forest industry (a principal target of Mapuche protest), largely to comply with an international certification regime called the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).  These initiatives, in turn, form part of a shift from public to private in the negotiation of indigenous rights, with far reaching implications, including associated changes in indigenous political strategies.  This paper argues that the Mapuche conflict embodies two larger trends, visible throughout the Americas:  a troubling retreat of state-endorsed “multicultural” rights; and a growing interest in de facto autonomy (autonomía sin permiso) on the part of indigenous and other subaltern social movements.  I conclude reflecting on how “historic debts” such as this one, left unpaid, produce social terrains in which incremental progress toward conflict resolution is an insult to the aggrieved, and the necessary radical change is so politically costly that only most resilient persist.  Naming this impasse—I stubbornly hope—might help us think through paths for moving beyond its formidable constraints.
Hale is a Professor of Anthropology and of African and African Diaspora Studies at University of Texas at Austin.
Internationally respected in his field of activist anthropology, Dr. Hale focuses on race and ethnicity, identity politics, and consciousness and resistance. He is a recent past president of the Latin American Studies Association (LASA), and the author of Más que un Indio: Racial Ambivalence and Neoliberal Multiculturalism in Guatemala and Resistance and Contradiction: Miskitu Indians and the Nicaraguan State, 1894–1987. He is also editor of Engaging Contradictions: Theory, Politics, and Methods of Activist Scholarship. Dr. Hale received his B.A. From Harvard and his Ph.D. from Stanford University. He taught at the University of California, Davis, before joining the faculty at the University of Texas in 1996.
His longstanding association with LLILAS dates from the early 1990s when he came here as an SSRC/MacArthur Fellow; he later served as the institute’s associate director from 1999–2003. From 1999–2004, he co-directed, with Richard Flores, the Rockefeller Residency Program “Race, Rights, and Resources in the Americas” for Postdoctoral Studies. He also served as chair of the LLILAS Publications Committee, the acquisitions committee for the LLILAS book series with the University of Texas Press.
Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies welcomes Prof. Charles R. Hale, UT Dept. of Anthropology, as the institute's new director effective September 1, 2009. Following an international search, Dr. Hale was selected by a university-wide committee of representatives from the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Fine Arts, the LBJ School, and the Law School.
This event is co-sponsored by the Latin American Studies Program.

Public Astronomy Lecture: "NASA's Cassini Spacecraft Views the Active Moon Enceladus"Fuertes ObservatoryJoin us in the Fuertes Observatory classroom at 7:30pm this Friday for a lecture by Dr. Paul Helfenstein titled NASA's Cassini Spacecraft Views the Active Moon Enceladus. NASA's Cassini spacecraft has been in orbit around Saturn since 2004, and has taken astonishing images of the Saturnian system; many incredible scientific discoveries have been made by the orbiter. Dr. Helfenstein is a member of the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) Team, and will present a review of Cassini imaging camera results that show the unique geology and geyser activity on Enceladus. Enceladus likely has a liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface, and is therefore one of the best candidates to find alien life in the Solar System. 
Following the lecture, observing through the observatory's telescopes (if clear) and tours of the historic building (regardless of weather) will take place until midnight.
